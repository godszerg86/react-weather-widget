# React weather widget

A react component displaying local weather with functionality to search for city or airport and display weather.  
*P.S. This is my first npm package and deployed react component, so do not judge strictly ;)*

Live demo

## Prerequisite

1. API key from [mapquest.com](https://developer.mapquest.com/), since it uses their api to locate places, deliver city background image and predict search.
2. API key from [darksky.net](https://darksky.net/dev), since it uses their api for weather information.
3. Recomended to use [create-react-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-react-app).
